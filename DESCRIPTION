Title: COVID-19 data resources and analysis tools
Description: On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared
    coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a Public Health Emergency of
    International concern (PHEIC) and within six weeks had
    characterized the outbreak as a pandemic. Compared to the 2003-2004
    severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) PHEIC, the COVID-19
    pandemic spreads more quickly and with a much higher death
    toll. However, the current pandemic is occurring in a more digital
    and interconnected world. Traditional public health organizations
    as well as data-mature organizations not traditionally involved
    directly in public health have rapidly developed digital disease
    surveillance infrastructuree that provides nearly realtime epidemic
    tracking data. These data resources have proven invaluable to
    understanding disease spread, to drive non-pharmacologic
    intervention (NPI), and, when combined with additional data
    resources, to project impacts to communities and healthcare systems
    around the world. Even as the urgency of the initial “hammer” of
    the COVID-19 pandemic begins to abate, the need for timely, robust,
    and granular datasets will inform business, policy, and even
    personal decisions for months or even years to come. This package provides
    documentation and access to highly-cited COVID-19 datasets and 
    secondary data that allow real-time analysis, visualization, and
    interpretation of the state of COVID-19 at a community, national, 
    or international level. By exposing these resources easily to the
    enormous community of data scientists using R, we hope to increase
    value and accelarate reporting, analysis, and decision-making.
