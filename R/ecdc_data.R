#' From the [ECDC website](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/covid-19/data-collection)
#' last accessed April 24, 2020:
#' 
#' Since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, ECDC’s Epidemic
#' Intelligence team has been collecting the number of COVID-19 cases
#' and deaths, based on reports from health authorities
#' worldwide. This comprehensive and systematic process is carried out
#' on a daily basis. To insure the accuracy and reliability of the
#' data, this process is being constantly refined. This helps to
#' monitor and interpret the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic not
#' only in the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area (EEA),
#' but also worldwide.
#' 
#' Every day between 6.00 and 10.00 CET, a team of epidemiologists
#' screens up to 500 relevant sources to collect the latest
#' figures. The data screening is followed by ECDC’s standard epidemic
#' intelligence process for which every single data entry is validated
#' and documented in an ECDC database. An extract of this database,
#' complete with up-to-date figures and data visualisations, is then
#' shared on the ECDC website, ensuring a maximum level of
#' transparency.
#'
#' ECDC receives regular updates from EU/EEA countries through the
#' Early Warning and Response System (EWRS), The European Surveillance
#' System (TESSy), the World Health Organization (WHO) and email
#' exchanges with other international stakeholders. This information
#' is complemented by screening up to 500 sources every day to collect
#' COVID-19 figures from 196 countries. This includes websites of
#' ministries of health (43% of the total number of sources), websites
#' of public health institutes (9%), websites from other national
#' authorities (ministries of social services and welfare,
#' governments, prime minister cabinets, cabinets of ministries,
#' websites on health statistics and official response teams) (6%),
#' WHO websites and WHO situation reports (2%), and official
#' dashboards and interactive maps from national and international
#' institutions (10%). In addition, ECDC screens social media accounts
#' maintained by national authorities, for example Twitter, Facebook,
#' YouTube or Telegram accounts run by ministries of health (28%) and
#' other official sources (e.g. official media outlets) (2%). Several
#' media and social media sources are screened to gather additional
#' information which can be validated with the official sources
#' previously mentioned. Only cases and deaths reported by the
#' national and regional competent authorities from the countries and
#' territories listed are aggregated in our database.
