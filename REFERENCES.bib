               outbreak responses",

  abstract  = "Decision makers are responsible for directing staffing,
               logistics, selecting public health interventions, communicating
               to professionals and the public, planning future response needs,
               and establishing strategic and tactical priorities along with
               their funding requirements. Decision makers need to rapidly
               synthesize data from different experts across multiple
               disciplines, bridge data gaps and translate epidemiological
               analysis into an operational set of decisions for disease
               control. Analytic approaches can be defined for specific
               response phases: investigation, scale-up and control. These
               approaches include: improved applications of quantitative
               methods to generate insightful epidemiological descriptions of
               outbreaks; robust investigations of causal agents and risk
               factors; tools to assess response needs; identifying and
               monitoring optimal interventions or combinations of
               interventions; and forecasting for response planning. Data
               science and quantitative approaches can improve decision-making
               in outbreak response. To realize these benefits, we need to
               develop a structured approach that will improve the quality and
               timeliness of data collected during outbreaks, establish
               analytic teams within the response structure and define a
               research agenda for data analytics in outbreak response. This
               article is part of the theme issue 'Modelling infectious disease
               outbreaks in humans, animals and plants: epidemic forecasting
               and control'. This theme issue is linked with the earlier issue
               'Modelling infectious disease outbreaks in humans, animals and

                   reduce the transmission rate of the severe acute respiratory
                   syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We use anonymized

                   mobility, a statistic representing the distance a typical
                   member of a given population moves in a day. Results
                   indicate that a large reduction in mobility has taken place,

  abstract  = "BackgroundPopulation estimates underpin demographic and
               epidemiological research and are used to track progress on
               numerous international indicators of health and development. To
               date, internationally available estimates of population and
               fertility, although useful, have not been produced with
               transparent and replicable methods and do not use standardised
               estimates of mortality. We present single-calendar year and
               single-year of age estimates of fertility and population by sex
               with standardised and replicable methods.",
