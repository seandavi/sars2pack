- subtitle: Excess deaths
  desc: '''Excess mortality'' refers to the difference between deaths from all causes
    during the pandemic and the historic seasonal average. For many jurisdictions
    for which data are available, this figure is higher than the official Covid-19
    fatalities that are published by governments each day. While not all of these
    deaths are necessarily attributable to the disease, it does leave a number of
    unexplained deaths that suggests that the official figures of deaths attributed
    may significant undercounts of the pandemic''s impact.'
